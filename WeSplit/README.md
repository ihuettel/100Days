# WeSplit

WeSplit is a check-splitting app designed to make it easier for groups of people to easily determine how much each of them need to contribute when splitting the cost of something, such as a large meal at a restaurant.

I'm building this app purely for educational purposes for an introduction to SwiftUI as part of Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift.
The only code I've written in this project is in the file: WeSplit/ContentView

* Wish me luck
