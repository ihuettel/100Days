# Moonshot

Project #11 in 100 Days of SwiftUI

This app will give users a chance to learn more about the NASA's Apollo missions.

In this project, we'll be spending more time with Codable as well as exploring ScrollView, NavigationLink, and other fun stuff.

I also accidentally built this project with additional macOS files. Perhaps I'll try and get it running on macOS too. Granted, I haven't even published even for testing purposes yet, so we'll see if that ends up being a thing.

Let's give it a go!
