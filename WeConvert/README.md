# WeConvert

Second project of Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI.

This time, we're working on creating an app that does conversions from one format to another.

I might start out just doing temperature or length conversions,
but I would like to try and setup a multi-page app that allows
for the conversion of all suggested types.

All code I've written is located in WeConvert/ContentView.swift
