# Guess the Flag

This is the third project in Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI series.
It involves building a game that asks players to guess which of three flags belongs to a given country.

Building this teaches more introductory SwiftUI content such as stacks (VStack, HStack, ZStack), Image, and Alert.
