# Views and Modifiers

Project #4 in 100 Days of SwiftUI

This is more of a technique project than any of the previous projects.

The importance is mostly on exlporing and poking around the different ways structs are used to implement Views and ViewModifiers.
We'll also be setting up extensions on View for ViewModifiers to write (hopefully) clearer code.

Speaking of clearer code, this is my first project that I added comments to the entire ContentView file.
As this is a learning experience for me -- and potentially others -- I am currently intending to write very detailed comments.

Some of the comments may be unneccsary for people who are more familar with Swift, however I'm currently taking the "better safe than sorry" approach at the moment.
I'm also experiementing with how I want to write my comments (and where Swift will let me write them), and as such this is not following any particular style guide and should probably not be used as an example for good comment writing. 

Unless it is, then feel free!
