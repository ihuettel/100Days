# Views and Modifiers

Project #8 in 100 Days of SwiftUI

This is the second technique project I've embarked upon.

We're once again diving into a less polish-focused and a more learning-focused example for different types of animations, transitions, and custom modifiers for said animations.

We also take a brief look at modifying views and having items appear conditionally on the screen (sometimes they're there; sometimes they're not!)

It's a bit of a jumbled mess, but there's a few neat things in there.
