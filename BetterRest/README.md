# BetterRest

This project is my 6th project at this point with Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI.

While most of the content here, UI wise, is stuff that I've worked with in previous projects, the big thing here is the introduction of developing apps in Xcode that utilize machine learning (by utilizing Create ML).

This is also my second attempt at learning how to build tests using XCTest, so that's hopefully getting a little better. 

I'm also forcing myself to use more git features that may not be necessary for me but are useful for me to know. (I'm trying to eat my vegetables...)

Comments are...forthcoming.
