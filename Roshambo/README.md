# Roshambo

This is my 5th project with Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI.

This project is more freeform -- a description of the app was given, but how to specificly implement it was not aside from a few hints.

The goal was to build an app that challenges the player to correctly choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors against an opponents while trying to either win or (intentionally) lose. If the player chooses right 10 times, they win.

## Status: Completed

## ToDo:
* Make the alert text variables that handle the end of a game (made up of 10 rounds) as well as the end of a single round
* Add comments
