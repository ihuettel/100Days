# iExpense

Project #10 in 100 Days of SwiftUI

This will be an app for tracking expenses for a user.

The main goal of this project is to work on persistence, as pretty much all of the apps up to this point start with a clean slate every time, as well as looking into using @Observed/ObservableObject and @Environment wrappers.

This is also the first time encountering UserDefaults and JSON Encoding / Decoding (as a method of storing and retrieving data.)

Fun times!
