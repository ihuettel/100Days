# 100 Days of Swift

This is where I will be hosting all my projects from 100 Days of Swift.

This is also an adventure for me in Git/Github, so I'm playing around with merging repos.
I've never really done much with Git/Github before, so we'll see how much trouble this throws my way...

Fun times!

# WeSplit

WeSplit is a check-splitting app designed to make it easier for groups of people to easily determine how much each of them need to contribute when splitting the cost of something, such as a large meal at a restaurant.

I'm building this app purely for educational purposes for an introduction to SwiftUI as part of Paul Hudson's 100 Days of Swift.

* Wish me luck
