# 100 Days of Swift

This is where I will be hosting all my projects from 100 Days of Swift.

This is also an adventure for me in Git/Github, so I'm playing around with merging repos.
I've never really done much with Git/Github before, so we'll see how much trouble this throws my way...

Fun times!

Projects in order:
* WeSplit: helps to split a check between multiple people
* WeConvert: converts units of measure to other units of measure
* GuessTheFlag: a flag guessing game for various countries of the world
* More to come...
