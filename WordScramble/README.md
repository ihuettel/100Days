# Word Scramble

This is my 7th project with Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI.

This project is designed to introduce some of the reamining core features of SwiftUI (List, onAppear(), fatalError(), Bundle) in 

This app challenges players to enter in as many words as possible using only letters from a randomly given 8-letter word.

## Status: Completed

## ToDo:
* Add additional tests
* Add more comments



I realize I often list adding comments as a thing to do in the future. I know, generally it is a best practice to go through and do them while one is writing programs. The main reason I'm not doing it at this point in time is, as I'm learning so many new features, I want to force myself to go back and explain in a detailed way what my code does.
If I can't do that later on, I'll need to refresh myself on these topics instead of just shortcutting to what I knew I meant by reading my own comments.

..or at least that's what I tell myself to help me sleep at night.
